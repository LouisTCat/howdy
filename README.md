And also ordered lists (of course): 
 
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

## Task Lists

Can be handy to keep track of things to do:

- [x] Task one is done

- [x] Task three is done
- [ ] This task is not yet done

## Code Blocks

Are easy; just open and close with three backticks.

```javascript
var first
    var name
    first = name = prompt("Enter new name, or OK to end")
    while (name != "" && name != null) {
    	if (name < first)
		first = name
    	name = prompt("Enter new name, or OK to end")
    }
    document.write("

 First name alphabetically = " + first)
